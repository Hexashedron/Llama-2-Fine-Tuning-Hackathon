I have three professional passions- Learning, Mentoring and Transforming. After working as a global Procurement 
leader for over 17 years, I have realised data and analytics are the key changer to develop short terms and long 
terms Procurement & supply Chain strategy. I believe that Digital Procurement driven through advance analytics 
is fast emerging as the lynchpin of the demand driven supply chain which helps the customer better and make 
smarter and efficient decisions.  
Being an avid reader of supply chain heuristics and a technology driven Supply cain enthusiast, I have created high 
value generating procurement offshore/onshore shared cervices centres in 3 large multi-$ billion organisations, 
plus conducted procurement business in over 120+ countries. It includes but not limited to over billion dollars 
managed services end-to-end procurement and major techno-commercial contract alliances with strategic 
sourcing partners i.e., OEMs/ VARs, Distributers and Tier 1, 2, 3 partners. 
I bring across the table rich experience of Global End to end Procurement and various aspects of Demand 
management, Category Management, Business Partnering, Contract management, Distribution, Supply Chain Risk 
Management, Cross functional Team management. 
In my current role, I am leading Lifesciences & healthcare and financial customers and managing spend of over 
$350 Mn and leading a team of regional procurement lead and buyers. 
My self-driven successful past key initiatives have many a times exceeded saving targets, significant improvement 
in cash-to-cash cycle, targeted level of service and increased cash flow which impacted bottom line of the business 
by reduction of working capital requirement, and business growth.  
I am great fit for any Procurement & Supply chin leadership role.

I have three professional passions- Learning, Mentoring and Transforming. After working as a global Procurement 
leader for over 17 years, I have realised data and analytics are the key changer to develop short terms and long 
terms Procurement & supply Chain strategy. I believe that Digital Procurement driven through advance analytics 
is fast emerging as the lynchpin of the demand driven supply chain which helps the customer better and make 
smarter and efficient decisions.  
Being an avid reader of supply chain heuristics and a technology driven Supply cain enthusiast, I have created high 
value generating procurement offshore/onshore shared cervices centres in 3 large multi-$ billion organisations, 
plus conducted procurement business in over 120+ countries. It includes but not limited to over billion dollars 
managed services end-to-end procurement and major techno-commercial contract alliances with strategic 
sourcing partners i.e., OEMs/ VARs, Distributers and Tier 1, 2, 3 partners. 
I bring across the table rich experience of Global End to end Procurement and various aspects of Demand 
management, Category Management, Business Partnering, Contract management, Distribution, Supply Chain Risk 
Management, Cross functional Team management. 
In my current role, I am leading Lifesciences & healthcare and financial customers and managing spend of over 
$350 Mn and leading a team of regional procurement lead and buyers. 
My self-driven successful past key initiatives have many a times exceeded saving targets, significant improvement 
in cash-to-cash cycle, targeted level of service and increased cash flow which impacted bottom line of the business 
by reduction of working capital requirement, and business growth.  
I am great fit for any Procurement & Supply chin leadership role.

Current Problem: With the software development life cycle (SDLC) becoming complex today, delivery 
time spans reducing, software testers need to inform feedback and evaluations immediately to the 
development teams and disputes for raising non code or duplicate defects and vice versa. So what if, 
development team and testing team deliver more releases with reducing defects, reducing the time and 
cheaper with increasing productivity as well. 
So here is iPQA an intelligent predictive quality analytics tool which is a AI Powered adaptive tool for 
achieving modern QA to QE and testing objectives to overcome the test automation bottlenecks and 
unleash the power of test automation for Devops containerization environments and their CI/CD 
pipelines as well .In current defect management database near to 20 to 30 % of defects logged will be 
non-code defects or environment issues and most of them will be duplicate defects when working in a 
big team and wasting the time of developer by assigning them. 
Business Solution: The iPQA AI powered tool has the cognitive capabilities where it will provide 
recommendations for resolution of defects raised, auto prioritize based on historic data and help in 
elimination of Duplicates. And even for Devops containerization test execution frameworks, iPQA has 
cognitive APi's and before logging the defects it will hit Api's and then final filtered defects only logged.

Project 1: iPQA Project/Tool development (Intelligent Predictive Quality Analytics) 
Current Problem: With the software development life cycle (SDLC) becoming complex today, delivery 
time spans reducing, software testers need to inform feedback and evaluations immediately to the 
development teams and disputes for raising non code or duplicate defects and vice versa. So what if, 
development team and testing team deliver more releases with reducing defects, reducing the time and 
cheaper with increasing productivity as well. 
So here is iPQA an intelligent predictive quality analytics tool which is a AI Powered adaptive tool for 
achieving modern QA to QE and testing objectives to overcome the test automation bottlenecks and 
unleash the power of test automation for Devops containerization environments and their CI/CD 
pipelines as well .In current defect management database near to 20 to 30 % of defects logged will be 
non-code defects or environment issues and most of them will be duplicate defects when working in a 
big team and wasting the time of developer by assigning them. 
Business Solution: The iPQA AI powered tool has the cognitive capabilities where it will provide 
recommendations for resolution of defects raised, auto prioritize based on historic data and help in 
elimination of Duplicates. And even for Devops containerization test execution frameworks, iPQA has 
cognitive APi's and before logging the defects it will hit Api's and then final filtered defects only logged.

Project 1: iPQA Project/Tool development (Intelligent Predictive Quality Analytics) 
Current Problem: With the software development life cycle (SDLC) becoming complex today, delivery 
time spans reducing, software testers need to inform feedback and evaluations immediately to the 
development teams and disputes for raising non code or duplicate defects and vice versa. So what if, 
development team and testing team deliver more releases with reducing defects, reducing the time and 
cheaper with increasing productivity as well. 
So here is iPQA an intelligent predictive quality analytics tool which is a AI Powered adaptive tool for 
achieving modern QA to QE and testing objectives to overcome the test automation bottlenecks and 
unleash the power of test automation for Devops containerization environments and their CI/CD 
pipelines as well .In current defect management database near to 20 to 30 % of defects logged will be 
non-code defects or environment issues and most of them will be duplicate defects when working in a 
big team and wasting the time of developer by assigning them. 
Business Solution: The iPQA AI powered tool has the cognitive capabilities where it will provide 
recommendations for resolution of defects raised, auto prioritize based on historic data and help in 
elimination of Duplicates. And even for Devops containerization test execution frameworks, iPQA has 
cognitive APi's and before logging the defects it will hit Api's and then final filtered defects only logged.

As Part of Data & AI team, which is a R & D division, mandates and currently focusing or working on 
all Predictive & Text Analytics (NLP). 
Key Roles & Responsibilities 
Drive Operational Excellence: Ensure execution of critical Predictive & Text Mining projects, 
including driving innovative implementation and insights derived from data. 
Consultant: Providing thought leadership and best practices related to critical Predictive & Text Mining 
projects. Identify specific capability, practices, tools, and people that the organization would need to 
develop. 
Solutioning: Understanding different business problems in different business line and solving analytical

Project 1: iPQA Project/Tool development (Intelligent Predictive Quality Analytics) 
Current Problem: With the software development life cycle (SDLC) becoming complex today, delivery 
time spans reducing, software testers need to inform feedback and evaluations immediately to the 
development teams and disputes for raising non code or duplicate defects and vice versa. So what if, 
development team and testing team deliver more releases with reducing defects, reducing the time and 
cheaper with increasing productivity as well. 
So here is iPQA an intelligent predictive quality analytics tool which is a AI Powered adaptive tool for 
achieving modern QA to QE and testing objectives to overcome the test automation bottlenecks and 
unleash the power of test automation for Devops containerization environments and their CI/CD 
pipelines as well .In current defect management database near to 20 to 30 % of defects logged will be 
non-code defects or environment issues and most of them will be duplicate defects when working in a 
big team and wasting the time of developer by assigning them. 
Business Solution: The iPQA AI powered tool has the cognitive capabilities where it will provide 
recommendations for resolution of defects raised, auto prioritize based on historic data and help in 
elimination of Duplicates. And even for Devops containerization test execution frameworks, iPQA has 
cognitive APi's and before logging the defects it will hit Api's and then final filtered defects only logged.

Project 1: iPQA Project/Tool development (Intelligent Predictive Quality Analytics) 
Current Problem: With the software development life cycle (SDLC) becoming complex today, delivery 
time spans reducing, software testers need to inform feedback and evaluations immediately to the 
development teams and disputes for raising non code or duplicate defects and vice versa. So what if, 
development team and testing team deliver more releases with reducing defects, reducing the time and 
cheaper with increasing productivity as well. 
So here is iPQA an intelligent predictive quality analytics tool which is a AI Powered adaptive tool for 
achieving modern QA to QE and testing objectives to overcome the test automation bottlenecks and 
unleash the power of test automation for Devops containerization environments and their CI/CD 
pipelines as well .In current defect management database near to 20 to 30 % of defects logged will be 
non-code defects or environment issues and most of them will be duplicate defects when working in a 
big team and wasting the time of developer by assigning them. 
Business Solution: The iPQA AI powered tool has the cognitive capabilities where it will provide 
recommendations for resolution of defects raised, auto prioritize based on historic data and help in 
elimination of Duplicates. And even for Devops containerization test execution frameworks, iPQA has 
cognitive APi's and before logging the defects it will hit Api's and then final filtered defects only logged.
